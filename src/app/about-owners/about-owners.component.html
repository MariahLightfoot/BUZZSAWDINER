        <h2>Meet the Paul and Lois</h2>
        <p>
            Paul grew up on The Hill in St. Louis, MO. 
            Some of his fondest memories are the smells of homemade Italian staples filling the streets, 
            local shop owners joyfully handing out samples. Lois has always had an affinity
            towards people, working as a nurse for the last 30 years has only made it grow stronger. 
            Together, they work hard to provide the feeling of community that is so hard
            to recreate in today's world.
